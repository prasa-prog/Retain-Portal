## Context
Since 2024 "Name Withheld" company undergo,

 AVERAGE MONTHLY ABSENTIEESM RATE OF 4.03%
 
 AVERAGE MONTHLY LTO RATE OF 6.7%
 
 CUMULATIVE LTO OF 47%
 
Hence effective attention towards employee management is required.
## Presumption

👨‍🏫 As general economics implies that utility proportional to demand,

👨‍🏫 while principle of diminishing marginal utility states that as more of a good or service is consumed, the marginal benefit of the next unit decreases.

👨‍🏫 According to the above scenario employees of "Name Withheld" company exhibits high rate of diminishing marginal utility,Hence they tend to be diverted.

--- INTERPRETATION ---

𝐿𝑇𝑂 = 1.06𝑋_1 − 0.46𝑋_2 − 0.3𝑋_3 − 1.27𝑋_4 + 0.42𝑋_5 − 0.06𝑋_6 + 1.37𝑋_7 - 2.4

𝑋_1 <------ Work satisfaction level

𝑋_2 <------ Salary

𝑋_3 <------ Welfare

𝑋_4 <------  Work Physical Environment

𝑋_5 <------ Work Stress

𝑋_6 <------  Staff

𝑋_7 <------ Other(External)

🧭 According to the observed relationship between Work Satisfatction and respective reason categories,

🧭 Salary, Welfare, Work Environment and Staff shows negative correlation with LTO state. 

🧭 That implies general working enviromnet and management not affected to the LTO decision significantly.

🧭 However Work Stress Shows Positive correlation with LTO and it is obvious in general sense.

🧭 Since staff not being material for LTO while work stress being material for LTO shows the quality of employees take nothing with personal of work.

🧭 External factors shows positive correlationship to the LTO that is also feasible, to adapt that scenario strategic innitiatives should be taken.

🚩 Most controvertial reveal is Work satisfaction Level shows Positive Correlation With LTO possible Conclusions for that,

🕵️ Employees hasn't good intuition about expressing their satisfaction level into a number.

🕵️ Employees not willingness to disclose their true emotions and next movements.

🕵️ Work Satisfaction is not potential measure for LTO Suseptibility.

🕵️ In order to ratain employees management could improve factors Salary, Welfare, Work Environment and responsible staff and reasonable work efficiencies.

🕵️ Furthermore Most of the glacier(external factors) still has been hidden.
